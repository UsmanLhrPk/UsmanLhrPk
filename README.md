As a Senior Software Engineer and DevOps specialist, I bring a strong foundation in a broad array of technologies, including Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Ruby, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Solr, JavaScript, and CI/CD. I am known for delivering scalable, high-quality software solutions and adapting quickly to new technologies and methodologies as the industry evolves. With a growth mindset, I continuously seek opportunities to refine both new and existing technologies to drive efficiency and innovation.

One of my core strengths is excelling in complex, detail-oriented projects. I am committed to designing solutions that not only meet but exceed client expectations, focusing on long-term scalability and precision. My experience with GitHub CI/CD pipelines has reinforced my agile development skills, enabling me to iterate rapidly and deliver consistent software updates.

Currently, at Cyber Nest, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to create and implement forward-thinking software solutions. My responsibilities include leading the technical design and development of new software projects, maintaining and optimizing legacy code, guiding and mentoring junior staff, and establishing CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployments. Additionally, I conduct training to keep the team up-to-date with the latest coding standards and best practices, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and technical excellence.

In addition to my software engineering expertise, I am a dedicated DevOps engineer specializing in AWS and Hostinger, with the flexibility to extend my skills to other platforms. My DevOps focus enables me to bridge development and operations seamlessly, ensuring the efficient, automated deployment and smooth operation of applications.

I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to a dynamic team, bringing my technical skills and innovative mindset to the development of cutting-edge software products.
