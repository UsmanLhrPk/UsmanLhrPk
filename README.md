As a Senior Software Engineer, I have a strong foundation in a range of technologies, including Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Ruby, PHP, MySQL, Postgres, and Redis. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality software solutions and am adept at adapting to new technologies and approaches as needed.
With a growth mindset, I always strive to learn and improve new and existing technologies.

One of my key strengths is my ability to excel in complex, intricate projects. I have a keen attention to detail and am able to deliver scalable solutions that meet the needs of my clients. My experience with Github CI/CD has also given me a solid understanding of agile development practices and the ability to quickly iterate and deliver updates to software products.
